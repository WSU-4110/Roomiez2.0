# Roomiez

## A website to connect people looking for a roommate!
### Functionality
The functionality behind Roomiez is for users to create 
a profile in order to connect with other members looking for a
roommate. Users can post that they are looking for a place to rent
or if they are looking for a place to rent out. Users will create 
a profile and fill out a questionnaire to lead them to their best
potential matches. 

### Purpose
The purpose of Roomiez is to create an environment where users are
able to share their personality online, similar to a dating app, in
order to match users together based on location, recommendations and
other key elements.
